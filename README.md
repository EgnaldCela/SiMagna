# SiMagna: Your guide to Italian cuisine using Object Detection with YOLOv11 model
An object detection project leveraging YOLO-based models, designed to explore scalability, model interpretability, and user interaction through a simple GUI.

##  Overview
SiMagna is a YOLOv11-based object detection model developed as a final project for the AI Lab: Computer Vision and NLP course. Trained on a custom dataset compiled from Google Datasets, Kaggle, and Roboflow, the model recognizes over 15 key ingredients commonly used in Italian cuisine.

With a simple and user-friendly interface, users can take a photo of their fridge, and SiMagna will detect the ingredients and recommend the top three Italian recipes they can prepare. This project combines computer vision and an efficient recipe recommendation system to make meal decisions easier and more enjoyable.

## How to Clone the Repository

You can clone this repository to your local machine by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ppietropiccolo/siMagna.git
```

## Dataset
We created the dataset as a composition of the following datasets all publicly online.  

The dataset we trained on is not on the repository due to its  size but we will put it to Kaggle in a few days of time.
