### pipeline
1. Object detection -> yolo or something else, use existing one
2. CNN to recognise objects -> i think we can and should create it train it ourselves  
    we could do some data augmentation account for rotated/flipped objects
3. Recipe suggestions -> API for online big model, pre existing
4. Graphical interface -> gradio? made by us

### Everything screwed, just train yolo
